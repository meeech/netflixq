NetflixQ
========

What?
-----

Chrome Extension to keep a list of Netflix movies to watch. 

**Features**

* Adds a **netflixQ** button under Play button. Click that, and it will add to your list.
* Click on the Yellow Star icon in your toolbar, and you will see your list of movies you want to watch.

Why?

Just subscribed to [netflix.ca](http://www.netflix.ca), and was browsing the movies. I couldn't find a 'digital' queue for what I wanted to watch later. Seems like an obvious feature for them to have built in, so wonder if I'm missing something obvious? 

In any case, I suppose I could just bookmark the movies, but I wanted to make a chrome extension. This seemed like a simple enough use case.

Nothing to fancy right now - does what it says, will add stuff as needed, or upon request.
